# Bot Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Identified

1. The main issue was that the `SneakerScraper` class didn't have a `scrape()` method, but the code was trying to call it.
   - The base scraper had a `scrape_site()` method but not a `scrape()` method.
   - This caused the bot to fail silently when trying to run scrapers.

2. Other minor issues:
   - Some terminal output was not displaying correctly
   - MongoDB connection might have had issues
   - Website structure might have changed since the scrapers were written

## Fixes Implemented

1. Added a `scrape()` method to the `BaseSneakerScraper` class
   - This method calls the existing `scrape_site()` method
   - Ensures backward compatibility with existing code

2. Created better debugging tools:
   - `bot_test.py` - Tests the scrapers and logs output
   - `run_fixed_bot.bat` - Runs the bot with proper logging
   - Updated README with troubleshooting information

3. Fixed other issues:
   - Added better error handling and logging
   - Updated README with clear instructions
   - Created convenience scripts for running the bot

## Next Steps

1. Run the bot with the fixed code using:
   ```
   run_fixed_bot.bat
   ```

2. Check if the scrapers are working by running:
   ```
   python debug_scraping.py
   ```

3. If you want to add more scrapers, you'll need to:
   - Create a new scraper class in the `scrapers` folder
   - Update the scraper mapping in `scrapers/factory.py`
   - Update the site configuration in `config/sites.py`

4. For any further issues, check the log files:
   - `bot_test.log`
   - `darkbot_run_*.log`
