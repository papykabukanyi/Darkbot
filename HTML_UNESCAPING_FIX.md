# HTML Unescaping Fix Documentation

## Problem Description
The bot was crashing when encountering escaped HTML entities in website responses, particularly from sites like Undefeated. These sites return escaped HTML with characters like `\u003C` instead of `<`. This was causing parsing failures and preventing deal emails from being sent.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `run_scraper` Function
- Added specific handling for `UnicodeDecodeError` exceptions
- Added general exception handling to prevent any scraper errors from crashing the entire bot
- Ensures the function returns an empty list instead of crashing when errors occur

### 2. HTML Unescaping in `base_scraper.py`
- Added HTML unescaping to the `get_page` method in the base scraper class
- Implemented three methods of unescaping:
  - Standard `html.unescape()`
  - Direct string replacement for `\u003C` and `\u003E` characters
  - Combined approach using both methods

### 3. Improved Error Handling in `run_scraper_job`
- Added nested try-except blocks to ensure one scraper failure doesn't prevent others from running
- Added specific handling for HTML parsing issues related to Unicode decoding
- Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 4. Added Robustness to `save_and_upload_deals`
- Added null check for the analyzed_deals parameter
- Ensures deals list is never null, preventing crashes when sending emails

### 5. Created Test Scripts
- `test_html_unescape.py` - Tests different HTML unescaping methods
- `test_undefeated_scraper.py` - Tests specifically for the Undefeated scraper
- `test_adidas_scraper.py` - Tests the new Adidas scraper

## New Features

### 1. Added Custom Adidas Scraper
- Created a dedicated Adidas scraper in `adidas.py`
- Implemented proper product parsing for Adidas website
- Added human-like scrolling behavior to load more products
- Updated the scraper factory to use the dedicated Adidas scraper

### 2. Updated Configuration
- Updated Adidas sale URL to use the correct link (`https://www.adidas.com/us/new_to_sale`)
- Added market price flag to Adidas config for better price comparison

## How to Test

### HTML Unescaping Test
Run `test_html_unescape.bat` to test different HTML unescaping methods and verify they work correctly.

### Undefeated Scraper Test
Run `test_undefeated_scraper.bat` to specifically test if the Undefeated scraper can handle escaped HTML.

### Adidas Scraper Test
Run `test_adidas_scraper.bat` to test the new Adidas scraper functionality.

### Email Notification Test
Run `test_email_notifications.bat` to test if email notifications are sent correctly.

## Manual Testing
1. Run the main.py script with --sites adidas to specifically test the Adidas site
2. Check if deals are found and emails are sent
3. Verify the HTML content is correctly parsed by examining the deal information
