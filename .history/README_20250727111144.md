## Setup

1. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure settings in `config.py`
   - Set your email notification preferences
   - Configure MongoDB connection settings
   - Adjust website URLs and rate limits
   - Set minimum discount percentage

4. MongoDB Configuration:
   - The bot is pre-configured with the following connection string:
   ```text
   mongodb://mongo:SMhYDmJOIDZMrHqHhVJRIHzxcOfJUaNr@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:51019
   ```
   - You can modify this in config.py or use command-line arguments

## Running the Bot

### Railway Deployment (Recommended for 24/7 Operation)

For continuous 24/7 operation, deploy the bot to Railway:

1. Follow the instructions in [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Railway will keep the bot running automatically
3. No need to keep your computer on
4. Automatic restart if the bot crashes

### Local Automatic Mode

For running on your local machine:

- `auto_start.bat` - Sets up environment, installs requirements, and starts the bot in continuous mode with 30-minute intervals

This script will:
1. Create a virtual environment if needed
2. Install all required packages
3. Start the bot in continuous mode with 30-minute intervals
4. Log all output to a timestamped log file
5. Send email notifications every 30 minutes to configured recipients

### Other Quick Start Options

Alternative batch files for different use cases:

- `run_fixed_bot.bat` - Runs the bot with all working scrapers and logs output
- `run_working_scrapers.bat` - Runs only the verified scrapers

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python main.py                                        # Run once
python main.py --continuous --interval 30             # Run every 30 minutes

# Site selection
python main.py --sites sneakers champssports          # Run for specific sites
python main.py --list-sites                           # Show all available sites

# MongoDB specific options
python main.py --mongodb                              # Force enable MongoDB storage
python main.py --mongodb-connection "your-connection-string"

# Advanced usage
python main.py --continuous --interval 30 --iterate   # Auto-continue if new deals found
python main.py --export-json                          # Export deals to JSON
python main.py --verbose                              # Show detailed output
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you're using the correct Python version:
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.8+
   ```

2. Run the debug script to test scrapers:
   ```bash
   python debug_scraping.py
   ```

3. Check for log files:
   ```
   bot_test.log
   darkbot_run_*.log
   ```

4. Common issues:
   - **No output**: Make sure you're using `--verbose` flag
   - **Scraper errors**: Some websites may have changed their structure
   - **MongoDB errors**: Verify your connection string is valid

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed missing `scrape()` method in scrapers
- Updated MongoDB connection handling
- Added additional debugging tools
