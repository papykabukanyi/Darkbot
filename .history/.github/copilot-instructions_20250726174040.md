# Sneaker Scraper Bot

This is a Python project for web scraping sneaker websites to find good deals for potential resale. The bot should behave like a human user and avoid detection.

Key considerations:
- Respect website terms of service and robots.txt
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Use rotating user agents
- Handle CAPTCHA if necessary
- Store data efficiently for price comparison
